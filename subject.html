      <h2>Subject 3: Seminar</h2>
      <p>
        The Department shall form an Internal Evaluation Committee (IEC) for the
        seminar with academic coordinator for that program as the
        Chairperson/Chairman and seminar coordinator & seminar guide as members.
        During the seminar presentation of a student, all members of IEC shall
        be present.  Formation of IEC and guide allotment shall be completed
        within a week after the University examination (or last working day) of
        the previous semester.  Guide shall provide required input to their
        students regarding the selection of topic/ paper.  Choosing a seminar
        topic: The topic for a UG seminar should be current and broad based
        rather than a very specific research work. It's advisable to choose a
        topic for the Seminar to be closely linked to the final year project
        area. Every member of the project team could choose or be assigned
        Seminar topics that covers various aspects linked to the Project area. 
        A topic/paper relevant to the discipline shall be selected by the
        student during the semester break.  Topic/Paper shall be finalized in
        the first week of the semester and shall be submitted to the IEC.  The
        IEC shall approve the selected topic/paper by the second week of the
        semester.  Accurate references from genuine peer reviewed published
        material to be given in the report and to be verified.
